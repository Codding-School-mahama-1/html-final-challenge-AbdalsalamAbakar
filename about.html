            <h1>This is a new section</h1>
            <p>In this section there will be a brief overview of how to link filesinternally
                and externally using anchor tags in HTML.
                An internal link is a hyperlink that points to another section within the same webpage or document.
                It allows users to navigate to different parts of the same page without leaving it.
                Internal links are typically created using anchor tags (<a>) with a "href" attribute that references
                an element's ID within the same page.
                For example, if you have a section with the ID "about-section", you can create an internal link to it like this:
                <a href="#about-section">Go to About Section</a>
                When users click on this link, they will be taken directly to the section with the ID "about-section" on the same page.
                Internal links are commonly used in long documents or webpages with multiple sections to enhance navigation and user experience.
